        <p>Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be
          the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is jealous of our love,
          angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.</p>

        <p>Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from
          up above. Can't replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. Thereâ€™s no
          going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the head that wears the
          crown.</p>

          pie but if you break her heart. But down to earth. It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. I
          guess that I forgot I had a choice.</p>
